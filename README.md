# TravelBot

## Inspiration
For our first hackathon, we wanted to create something light-hearted with a substantial body of pre-existing examples. We thus decided on a Discord bot through which users can check out different places around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has left many of us stuck at home all day; with TravelBot, we're reminded of what we have to look forward to by adhering to health guidelines!

## What it does
By reacting to TravelBot's messages with certain emojis, users can select virtual travel destinations and activities (e.g., exploring cities' traditional music).

## How we built it
We used Python and the discord.py API to program a Discord bot. It can be called to and used in any server.

## Challenges we faced
Despite our previous knowledge in Python, our unfamiliarity with discord.py presented a significant difficulty. While we were used to calling Python functions from other functions, for instance, we could not find any documentation to invoke discord.py commands from others! Another challenge was the time constraint; because we had to spend a lot of time researching our tools, we did not implement as many or as extensive features as we had envisioned. Moreover, we were unable to fully implement the code that would allow TravelBot to automatically play music from specified regions.

## Accomplishments we're proud of
We were able to create a functioning Discord bot without prior experience with discord.py, Github, or any sort of bot making. We're so proud to have completed our first Hackathon with a working product to show for it!

## What we learned
Through this experience, we got a taste of the sheer amount of work necessary to create even a simpler bot. As mentioned above, we also learned how to code collaboratively (and completely remotely!) using Git.

## What's next for TravelBot
We hope to expand our location options as well as travel activities. Some possible features include: teaching phrases in cities' local languages, providing users with a travel journal via a logging system, inviting virtual pet trip companions, and allowing users to move back and forth between cities, continent regions, etc. rather than the current one-directional pathway.
